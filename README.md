🌍 Just Launched: Travel Advisor Website (Responsive Web Project) ✈️

I'm thrilled to share a web development project I recently completed — a responsive travel website inspired by TripAdvisor! This site was built entirely using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean layout, responsive design, and user-friendly experience.

🔹 Project Highlights:

Built with HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling

Utilized Flexbox for a flexible, modern layout

Designed a fully responsive interface that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

Included high-quality travel images that scale and adjust seamlessly

Focused on clean UI/UX design principles to create an engaging user experience

Created custom destination cards, rating sections, and navigation bar

This project allowed me to practice core web development skills and understand how to build a layout that works across devices. I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to keep improving my front-end development journey.
